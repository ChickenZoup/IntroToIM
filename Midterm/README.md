***The Iceberg of The Unconscious***

**Overall project concept**

The question of what knowledge exists in our minds always fascinates me. For my midterm project, I wanted to explore the Freudian model which describes our conscious and unconscious.Below is an image that gave me the inspiration to create a model of an iceberg, using LEDs and switches to create a visual representation of the illuminating unconscious.
