**Interactive Observation**

In all student residential halls, the lights in the staircases are activated by sound. During anytime of the day, as soon as the sensors donâ€™t detect any sounds (meaning nobody is using the stairs) for a certain amount of time, the lights are automatically switched off. 

There are multiple positive benefits to this design: Firstly, it avoids the situation of lights being turned on all the time while nobody is even around in the staircases, thereby saving a significant amount of energy. Secondly, the implementation of the design is both financially beneficial for the school and friendly to the environment. 

However, the implementation of the design has two major drawbacks. The sensors are set so only sounds that reach a certain minimum volume can trigger the lights. For people with lighter footsteps, this normally means one has to intentionally create several loud steps to turn on the lights, and then proceeds to go up or down the stairs. There have also been cases where the sensors do not detect sounds until one is half way up a flight of stairs, resulting in delayed response from the lights.
