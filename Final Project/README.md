**Ambush From All Sides**


**Concept**
For my final project, I wanted to visualize a classical Chinese song 十面埋伏，which translates as ambush from all sides. Tradtionally performed by the instrument Pipa, the song portrays a fierce scene in a battle of which the general of one side faces enemies from all of his sides. The beginning sections of the music focus on the description of the assembled army of the Han. The music in these sections is forceful and lively, with percussive sounds on pipa imitating drums and horns. The beat of drums gets gradually faster to depict the increasingly tense atmosphere before the onset of the battle. The main part of the music is played in a rapid manner, utilising a variety of pipa techniques to describe the furious battle between the armies of Chu and Han, such as flipping, sweeping, circular fingering, wringing, rolling, and halting. The end of the piece dipicts the defeat of the general. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAEakqIc1NM)

I hope to recreate the tenseness and structure of this piece through processing, incorporating elements that we have learned from data visualization and do some research on the side about how to visualize sounds.
