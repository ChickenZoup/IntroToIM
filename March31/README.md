**Recreate Old Computer Art**

For this assignment, we were asked to recreate an old computer art from an issue of “Computer Graphics and Art”. Here is the image that I chose to recreate

My program generates different outcomes whenver it is run. Below is an example of what it can produce.

There are two bugs, or, as we call them in the IM department, features of my code. 
Firstly, as illustrated below, sometimes a part of the line of the shadow cube also gets cut off. This is because sometimes the white box which I used to cover some parts of the main cube gets overlapped with the shadow cube.

Additionally, and I am not sure why this happens, when I want to increase the amount of cubes displayed on the canvas, this happens. Honestly I think it looks quite cool, but dont really know why it happens. My guesses are because when I increase the canvas size, the potential radius of the cube gets increased, which means it would be longer.
