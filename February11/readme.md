**Here is the description for my light grid**

For this assignment, I created a circuit using Arduino that combines multiple digital inputs and outputs. There are 4 LEDs, two blue and two yellow, arranged in a 2x2 manner. Below them, lies 2 buttons, one yellow and one blue. When the yellow button is pressed, the four LEDs would blink in order, meaning that the two blue LEDs will flash first, followed by the two yellow LEDs. For the viewer, it looks like the four lights are flashing by groups categorized by color.  When the blue button is pressed, all LEDs are on. When both buttons are pressed, all lights are off (It is important to note that sometimes when both of them are pressed, the lights will quickly flash because when we manually press down, it is very difficult to press two buttons actually simotanously).
